# RemoteControls

PhoneGap / Cordova plugin that allows you to use Music Remote Controls.

## Supported platforms
- Android (4.1+)
- Windows (10+)
- iOS

## Require
- PhoneGap / Cordova 3.x

## Installation

Add the plugin much like any other:

`cordova plugin add https://github.com/shi11/RemoteControls`

## Methods
- Create the media controls:
```javascript
MusicControls.create({
    track       : 'Time is Running Out',
	artist      : 'Muse',
    cover       : 'albums/absolution.jpg',
    isPlaying   : true
	album       : 'Absolution', // iOS only
	duration    : 321,			// iOS only
	elapsedTime : 123			// iOS only
}, onSuccess, onError);
```

- Destroy the media controller:
```javascript
MusicControls.destroy(onSuccess, onError);
```

- Subscribe events to the media controller:
```javascript
function events(action) {
	switch(action) {
		case 'music-controls-next':
			// Do something
			break;
		case 'music-controls-previous':
			// Do something
			break;
		case 'music-controls-pause':
			// Do something
			break;
		case 'music-controls-play':
			// Do something
			break;

		// Headset events (Android only)
		case 'music-controls-media-button' :
			// Do something
			break;
		case 'music-controls-headset-unplugged':
			// Do something
			break;
		case 'music-controls-headset-plugged':
			// Do something
			break;
		default:
			break;
	}
}

// Register callback
MusicControls.subscribe(events);

// Start listening for events
// The plugin will run the events function each time an event is fired
MusicControls.listen();
```

## iOS specific

Modify the MainViewController.m with these functions:

```
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.
    [[RemoteControls remoteControls] setWebView:self.webView];
}

- (void)viewDidUnload
{
    [super viewDidUnload];
    // Release any retained subviews of the main view.
    // e.g. self.myOutlet = nil;
    // Turn off remote control event delivery
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endReceivingRemoteControlEvents];
}

//add this function
- (void)remoteControlReceivedWithEvent:(UIEvent *)receivedEvent {
       [[RemoteControls remoteControls] receiveRemoteEvent:receivedEvent];
   }
```
